# Visualization tool for a simple Heyting algebra

A tool for interactive visualization of a simple Heyting algebra on the [0, 1] interval. 
a -> b is defined as the greatest c s.t. min(a, c) <= b (see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyting_algebra) for more details).

New formulas can be added and removed. 
New formulas support negation (NEG), disjunction (OR), conjunction (AND), and conditional (TO). 

[Here](https://mobile.twitter.com/CarcassiFausto/status/1125052600506822656) are a couple gifs that illustrate how the interaction works.
